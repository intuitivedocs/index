title:  "Documentation Process"

Jekyll is the software we use to convert markdown files into our documentation websites.

All documentation sites we maintain are referenced from [intuitivedocs.github.io/index]

Each documentation website has its own github repository. The github username of the repository owner forms the first part of the url - “intuitivedocs”, and the repository name forms the third part of the url - “DevelopmentTeamDocumentation”.

The subtopics of this category explain how to add content and edit our sites.
